# Week3 Task Presentation


## What I did:
This week I was to complete a bunch of challenges on OWASP juice shop. 

| ![0 Star review](/assets/0star.png)  |
| I was able to leave  0 star review by finding a conditional attribute on the submit rating button and removing it .  |


| ![Bjorns account reset](/assets/bjorn.png) |
| I was able to reset Bjorn's password by finding  his security questions answer to his account using social media (doxing) and finding a video where he created his account. |

| ![Bjorns account reset](/assets/admin.png) |
| I was able to access the administrator page by finding reference to it in a java script. From there I was able to delete all 5 stars reviews using the GUI that I have. |

| ![Bjorns account reset](/assets/jim.png) |
| I reset Jim's Password by looking him up and finding his brothers middle name. |

I cracked viewing another users basket by logging in as two accounts, this confuses the site and registers that you are one user when you are currently acting as another..

| ![XSS Presentation](/assets/XSS1.png) |
| This was the slide of the presentation that I did regarding the impact of Cross Side Scripting(XSS). |

 | ![Natas Passwords](/assets/natas.png) |

## Problems I Faced:
This week I faced a few problems regarding to the class, I had little knowledge based on Burpsuite and as such, I was required to learn how to operate the tool on the go, I also had very little knowledge regarding to the syntax of a few of the penetration attacks such as SQL or XSS, this required me to put in more time understanding how these attacks are used and how they can exploit web vulnerabilities. Another problem faced this week was regarding communication amongst our group, though better than last week, I feel that better communication can still be achieved in order to more efficiently accomplish tasks  
Due to the criticism received from last week, I have attempted to include more artifacts in my portfolio.

## Reflection on last week
I listened to the advice given to me from my tutors and remade my week 1 reflection to better reflect what I have learned in class to better reflect what had happened that week. I went and added how I addressed the Subject Outlines in the document and also made sure I was adding artifacts in in order to validate the work that I was doing.

## How I have achieved the Subject Outcomes

### SO2
This week I was able to apply my design and system thinking skills through the development and research conducted on my presentation throughout the week. I was also able to apply my system thinking skills through the thought process that went into trying to crack some of the OWASP vulnerabilities.

| ### SO3 |
| I was able to apply technical skills this week by working on the different puzzles that were presented to me on Over the Wire and OWASP.  How I applied these skills can be seen in the above artifacts. |

| ### SO4 |
| This week I demonstrated collaboration and communication skills through the group work that we were assigned, it was through the creation of our own Microsoft Teams group that we ensured efficient communication amongst ourselves. It was through our designation of how the task that would be completed that we demonstrated our collaboration skills creating a system for the presentation that was fair as well as balanced amongst students. |

### SO5
This week I conducted critical review over our group and myself by adding sections to this reflection demonstrating the pitfalls and struggles we faced during this week. It is my belief that this will allow me to review my weekly actions more critically and ensure that I learn from my past mistakes. I also received criticism from tutors during our 1 on 1's allowing me to better preform for the future weeks
