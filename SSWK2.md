# Week2 Task Presentation


## What I did:
During this week I was able to participate in a group to complete a presentation based on a reconnaissance software called Gobuster. I also did a lot of puzzles in the picoCTF 2018 and 2019 where my scores currently sit at 200 and 1700 respectively. I also began the bandit level of over the wire where i currently sit on level 6.


 


## Problems I Faced:
This week I faced problems regarding communication amongst teammates, though we were able to make a group presentation together our work efforts being uncoordinated lead us to creating overlapping parts and taking over the designated time we were given to present. I plan on remedying this in the future with better group organization as well as setting out more time to focus on the timing of our presentation. We also failed to introduce our group before our presentation which can be remedied by remembering to do so before our next presentation.

Due to the failure of completing the first reflection up to the standards that were set by the class, I  went about redesigning the way I worked on completing the reflection.

## Reflection on last week
I listened to the advice given to me from my tutors and remade my week 1 reflection to better reflect what I have learned in class to better reflect what had happened that week. I went and added how I addressed the Subject Outlines in the document and also made sure I was adding artifacts in in order to validate the work that I was doing.

## How I have achieved the Subject Outcomes

### SO1
This Week I was able to engage with stakeholders by listening to two experts in the fields. Robert Mitchell who is currently a Security Engineering Manager at Gitlab and Patrick Kelso a UTS teacher who is an Expert in using Linux. Using this experience I was able to learn more about different parts of the Cyber Security Field.
### SO2
This week I was able to apply my design and system thinking skills through the development and research conducted on my presentation throughout the week. By thinking about the design of the slides I was able to create a presentation design that looked sleek but was still readable to the audience. It was also in my research of the tool I was able to comprehend how the tool functioned for website reconnaissance.

| ### SO3 |
| I was able to apply technical skills this week by working on the different puzzles that were presented to me on Over the Wire and picoCTF and complete them by using the tools available to me and also developing tools such as my Caesar Cypher solver. |
Two of the given tasks on the picoCTF challenges required me to be able to convert code using Caeser cyphers. As such I was able to make my own Caesar Cypher solver by making a list of letters, reading what character is currently being read determining its position in the alphabet and then shifts it to the next letter.  This allows me to be able to both encode and decode all shifting cyphers.

With the challenge 2warm I had to convert the number 42 into binary. I was able to do this by taking the biggest factor 2 away from 42 which is 32 which leaves 10. from there I take a way 8 and then 2 as such I then put it in the form of powers of 2 that I took away which equals 101010
With the challenge Glory of the Gardern part of the code appears to look like base 64 due to the fact that it ends with an equals symbol, a quick conversion reveals the flag
With the challenge Insp3t0r the key is split into 3 parts of the inspector menu. 1 part can be found just by inspecting code in the inspector element. This is due to how developers often hide code in there source materials. Parts 2 and 3 can be found in the javascript and css source files for the page another common place where developers leave information.
The challenge Lets Warm Up was just a simple hexadecimal to ASCII conversion. As such I immediately moved straight to a conversion table and found what it was equivalent to.
The Numbers challenge gave us numbers and some formatting, from previous experience I know of the abcto123 cypher a simple back conversion finds the flag
The challenge Warmed Up is yet another hexadecimal conversion this time into decimal, once again a quick look at a conversion table solves this one.

| ### SO4 |
| This week I demonstrated collaboration and communication skills through the group work that we were assigned, it was through the creation of our own Microsoft Teams group and our Facebook chat that we ensured efficient communication amongst ourselves. It was through our designation of the task that we demonstrated our collaboration skills creating a system for the presentation that was fair as well as balanced amongst students. |

### SO5
This week I conducted critical review over our group and myself by adding sections to this reflection demonstrating the pitfalls and struggles I faced during this week. It is my belief that this will allow me to review my weekly actions more critically and ensure that I learn from my past mistakes. I also received criticism from tutors during our 1 on 1's allowing me to better preform for the future weeks
