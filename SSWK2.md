# Week2 Task Presentation


## What I did:
During this week I was able to participate in a group to complete a presentation based on a reconnaissance software called Gobuster. I also did a lot of puzzles in the picoCTF 2018 and 2019 where my scores currently sit at 200 and 1700 respectively. I also began the bandit level of over the wire where i currently sit on level 6.

## Problems I Faced:
This week I faced problems regarding communication amongst teammates, though we were able to make a group presentation together our work efforts being uncoordinated lead us to creating overlapping parts and taking over the designated time we were given to present. I plan on remedying this in the future with better group organization as well as setting out more time to focus on the timing of our presentation. We also failed to introduce our group before our presentation which can be remedied by remembering to do so before our next presentation.

Due to the failure of completing the first reflection up to the standards that were set by the class, I  went about redesigning the way I worked on completing the reflection.

## Reflection on last week
I listened to the advice given to me from my tutors and remade my week 1 reflection to better reflect what I have learned in class to better reflect what had happened that week. I went and added how I addressed the Subject Outlines in the document and also made sure I was adding artifacts in in order to validate the work that I was doing.

## How I have achieved the Subject Outcomes

### SO1
This Week I was able to engage with stakeholders by listening to two experts in the fields. Robert Mitchell who is currently a Security Engineering Manager at Gitlab and Patrick Kelso a UTS teacher who is an Expert in using Linux. Using this experience I was able to learn more about different parts of the Cyber Security Field.
### SO2
This week I was able to apply my design and system thinking skills through the development and research conducted on my presentation throughout the week. By thinking about the design of the slides I was able to create a presentation design that looked sleek but was still readable to the audience. It was also in my research of the tool I was able to comprehend how the tool functioned for website reconnaissance.
### SO3
I was able to apply technical skills this week by working on the different puzzles that were presented to me on Over the Wire and picoCTF and complete them by using the tools available to me and also developing tools such as my Caesar Cypher solver.
### SO4
This week I demonstrated collaboration and communication skills through the group work that we were assigned, it was through the creation of our own Microsoft Teams group and our Facebook chat that we ensured efficient communication amongst ourselves. It was through our designation of the task that we demonstrated our collaboration skills creating a system for the presentation that was fair as well as balanced amongst students.
### SO5
This week I conducted critical review over our group and myself by adding sections to this reflection demonstrating the pitfalls and struggles we faced during this week. It is my belief that this will allow me to review my weekly actions more critically and ensure that I learn from my past mistakes. I also received criticism from tutors during our 1 on 1's allowing me to better preform for the future weeks
