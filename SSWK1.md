# Week1 Task Portfolio

## Why I chose this Studio
I chose this studio due to my interest in majoring in Cyber Security. I wish to see if I enjoy the work that is associated with the field and challenge myself by learning via a new learning method and learning different design based ways of creation and learning. I also enjoy participating in Capture The Flag competitions and would enjoy learning about more exploits commonly used to hide flags.

## What I want to get out of this:
I want to find out if I enjoy Cybersecurity to the point that I pursue it as a major for my Computer Science degree. I wish to learn the skills required to preform tasks that are essential in Cybersecurity so that I am able to carry out the roles required to work as a Cybersecurity Expert.
