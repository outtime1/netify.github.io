## Why I chose this Studio
I chose this studio due to my interest in majoring in Cyber Security. I wish to see if I enjoy the work that is associated with the field and challenge myself by learning via a new learning method and learning different design based ways of creation and learning. I also enjoy participating in Capture The Flag competitions and would enjoy learning about more exploits commonly used to hide flags. Furthermore I wish to learn more about the other forms of competitions and contests that are available to people who are interested in Cybersecurity.

## What I want to get out of this
I want to find out if I enjoy Cyber Security to the point that I pursue it as a major for my Computer Science degree. I wish to learn the skills and knowledge required to preform tasks that are essential in Cybersecurity so that I am able to carry out the roles required to work as a Cybersecurity Expert. I would like to develop a network consisting of  students, faculty and other people knowledgable in the Cybersecurity field to be able to both help me build up my computing skills as well as guide me into making the right types of choices when approaching issues that are relevant to the field. 


## What I did:
During this week I was able to accomplish the creation of my website blog.


Me installing Jekyll on my computer as a native package so that I am able to build my website and covert markdown scripts into html pages so that they can be viewed and formatted on the web


## Problems I Faced:
Learning the content required to set up my website such as Markdown, Jekyll, Git, Netlify as well as  learning what was actually required in my reflections.

## How I have achieved the Subject Outcomes:
### SO1
I was able to engage with stakeholders by learning from Matthew Brennan, a expert in Cyber security who was able to help us learn the process of learning Cyber security
### SO2
I was able to use design system thinking skills by working on how the design of my website would function and also in how the markdown language gets converted to HTML. I also learned how the git system worked and how I could maintain proper version control of my website

### SO3
I was able to apply technical skills in the creation and development of my website blog through the coding, pushing,  building and forwarding  of the website. These crucial steps made it possible for me to make my portfolio public for people to see. The coding of the website in markdown makes it quicker and easier to write websites than the blocky html. By pushing the website via github so that its version can be controlled stops problems such as reduancy from occuring and allows me to centralise the websites code. By getting it built in jekyll, I can add a theme to the desgin making it have a better feel than just plain text as well as better formatting. By pushing to my netlify domain, I am able to make the website public to those who want to see the work im doing and thus allowing me to complete the task as intended.
