By finding the Ip I then ran a port scan using nmap, the ports that were open we 21, 22, 80 and  65535. I started by looking at what I could do on port 80'### Port 80Port 80 usually used for HTTP connections had a website designed in word press that had been deployed. However it had been made except that all the source code linked to a domain that couldn't be found as such the files such as scripts or the CSS pages were not properly loaded meaning that the page looked broken. After trying to see I could load the wp-admin page, I also attempted looking over the site for further information in an attempt to find more information.I was able to find that a comment had been left on an admins comment, I tried seeing if the the next part of an archive was accessible by seeing if the pages archives were able to be accessed however this led me nowhere. After a while I thought I should look at the other ports.### Port 21Port 21 is a port used for FTP processes. After initially dismissing this as i required a login, I looked for ways to login and had found out through research that most servers allow anonymous connections. As such when I attempted to log in anonymously I was able to connect and access a file called backupPasswords that i could read. After getting the file I accessed it and saw that I got 5 strings of different passwords.
