# Summer Studio - Final Submission

## The SLO's
During these six weeks I actively engaged in different tasks that stood up to the different SLO's that I was tasked to carry out

### SLO1 - Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.
During the 6 weeks I endeavored to engage with different stakeholders in order to identify problems in Cyber Security
<p>
In Week 1: 
I engaged with Matthew Brennan a Cyber Security analyst who helped us the learn some of the basics of Cyber security
<p>
In Week2: 
I engaged with two experts in the Cyber Security field: UTS IT Teacher Patrick Kelso and Security Engineering Manger Robert Mitchell who were able to give us advice in different aspects of the Cyber Security field by answering any questions we were able to come up with.

Some notes that I took
<p>
In Week 4 : 
I sought to get advice from my teachers into what box I should attempt to complete for this week. With there council I chose to attempt the literally vulnerable box
<p>
In Week 5:
I engaged with the two representatives from Deloitte: Nathan Jones and Pieter Westein who showed us the different tools that they used to engage in red teaming operations

In Week 6:
I engaged with several members of the Google team who participated in the ninja night CTF who were able to provide unique insight into how I should approach CTF challenges in the future.

### SLO 2 - Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.  
During the six weeks I strived to apply design techniques into different forms of media as well as use system thinking to understand different forms of computer systems.
<p>
In Week1:
I made use of design and system thinking in order to understand how to deploy my website as a static site. This included me learning how git operated as a version control system and also how I could use Netlify to forward my webpage to a domain.

<p>
In Week2:
I applied design and system thinking by working on my deliverable; the powerpoint.  In this research I was able to grasp how my reconnaissance tool functioned by scanning different directories of sites while alos applying design thinking by considering how my powerpoint would be designed for the presentation

<p>
In Week3:
This week I applied my design and system thinking skills in a rather similar way as last week. This week I learned how Cross Site Scripting (XSS) functioned and exploited the system in which it ran on.

<p>
In Week 5:
This week I applied my design and system thinking skills by designing how I would present my write up of Open Admin to my tutors.
<p>
In Week 6 
I Applied my design and system thinking skills by designing both write ups of Open Admin and Travexec so that they demonstrated how I achieved root access on both boxes clearly and concisely.
### SLO 3 - Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs. 

### SLO 4 - Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills. 
During the six weeks, I did my best to go beyond my comfort zone and work as an effective group member amongst peers.
<p>
In Week2:
I used my collaborative skills to work as an effective group member and carry out the part of the presentation that I was tasked with completing.

<p>
In Week6:
I made use of collaboration and communication skills by not being afraid to seek advice from my peers but also in helping out in my group for the showcase by completing the task that was requested of me by my group member.

### SLO 5 - Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation.  
Over the 6 week I have had to conduct critical reflections and evaluations into the preformance of not only myself but also my peers and teachers as well. This was conducted weekly in both our stand up meeting as well as our 1 on 1 conversations with our tutors.
In Week1:
I was able to conduct a review of my actions for the week and record them in my review
<p>
In Week2:
I took on the advice of my tutors and tried to review my actions more reflectively by talking more in depth of what I had done
<p>

### What I Learned
This class has been incredibly informative for me taking me from an absolute outsider of the Cyber Security subject to a pretty knowledgable novice who wishes to improve his knowledge further. It has allowed me to develop and further technical skills in the fields of Pentesting such as reconnaissance and exploitation through the research and deployment of different tools and equipment, enhanced by design and system thinking skills through research, documentation and presenting skills. It has also improved my communication and collaboration skills both with peers but also with different stakeholders by teaching me that true progress requires multiple minds to work on different issues effectively. This course has also taught me to look upon my work critically, making me reconsider the quality of my submissions and improving them thusly. Finally this subject has kindled the passion that was developing in me for the subject of IT and I hope that I am able to further this passion with future classes in the field of Cyber Security.
