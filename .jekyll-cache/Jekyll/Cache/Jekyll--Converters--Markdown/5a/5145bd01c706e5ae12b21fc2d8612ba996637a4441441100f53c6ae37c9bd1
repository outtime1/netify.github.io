<p>This week I engaged with my Class tutors by seeking there advice on how to work through this weeks challenges. I sought there advice in picking what box I attempted for my deliverable this week. I also sought the advice of my teachers with regard to my design for my portfolio submissions trying my best to improve formatting and depth to the submission.</p>

<p>I was able to apply technical skills this week by working on the different puzzles that were presented to me by attempting to crack the boxes.</p>

<p>This week I demonstrated collaboration and communication skills through the group work that we were assigned, it was through the creation of our own Microsoft Teams group that we ensured efficient communication amongst ourselves. It was through our designation of how the task that would be completed that we demonstrated our collaboration skills creating a system for the presentation that was fair as well as balanced amongst students.</p>

<h3 id="slo5">SLO5</h3>
<p>This week I conducted critical review over our group and myself by adding sections to this reflection demonstrating the pitfalls and struggles we faced during this week. This weeks feedback left me to elaborate more on my submissions and try to explain the processes that I use to complete the challenges.</p>
