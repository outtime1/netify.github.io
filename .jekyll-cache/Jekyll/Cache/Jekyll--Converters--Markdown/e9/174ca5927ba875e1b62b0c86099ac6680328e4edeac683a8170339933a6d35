<h2 id="why-i-chose-this-studio">Why I chose this Studio</h2>
<p>I chose this studio due to my interest in majoring in Cyber Security. I wish to see if I enjoy the work that is associated with the field and challenge myself by learning via a new learning method and learning different design based ways of creation and learning. I also enjoy participating in Capture The Flag competitions and would enjoy learning about more exploits commonly used to hide flags. Furthermore I wish to learn more about the other forms of competitions and contests that are available to people who are interested in Cybersecurity.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-to-get-out-of-this">What I want to get out of this</h2>
<p>I want to find out if I enjoy Cyber Security to the point that I pursue it as a major for my Computer Science degree. I wish to learn the skills and knowledge required to preform tasks that are essential in Cybersecurity so that I am able to carry out the roles required to work as a Cybersecurity Expert. I would like to develop a network consisting of  students, faculty and other people knowledgable in the Cybersecurity field to be able to both help me build up my computing skills as well as guide me into making the right types of choices when approaching issues that are relevant to the field.</p>
