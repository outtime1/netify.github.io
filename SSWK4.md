## What I did:
This week I have attempted two boxes on vulnerable box and was able to crack one of them and made decent progress on the next one.

## Problems Faced this week. 

This week  I had a plethora of issues including the corrupting of my Kali box also the difficulty in time management as well as the difficulty of the box.



## How I achieved the SLO's this week

### SLO1
This week I engaged with my Class tutors by seeking there advice on how to work through this weeks challenges. I sought there advice in picking what box I attempted for my deliverable this week. I also sought the advice of my teachers with regard to my design for my portfolio submissions trying my best to improve formatting and depth to the submission.



### SLO3 
I was able to apply technical skills this week by working on the different puzzles that were presented to me by attempting to crack the boxes.

| By finding the Ip address of the literally vulnerable box, I was able to find the open ports that were available on the network.|


| ![File to Print](/assets/ftp.png) |
| By accessing the ftp server and logging in as an anonymous user, I was able to access a directory with the file for backup passwords. |


| ![Backup Passwords](/assets/password.png) |
| By extracting the passwords from the ftp server using the command recv the file, I deposited it in the directory I ran CMD in. By closing the ftp connection and opening it in notepad we receive a series of strings that we can then be used to enumerate a password. |

| ![Website](/assets/website.png) |
| By trying to access the website we were able to see this broken down unformatted wordpress site. It is hard to navigate due to every page not linking to the right domain. |

| It is however possible to redirect to the right domain by changing the links in the element so that they can be found. |


### SLO5
This week I conducted critical review over our group and myself by adding sections to this reflection demonstrating the pitfalls and struggles we faced during this week. This weeks feedback left me to elaborate more on my submissions and try to explain the processes that I use to complete the challenges.
