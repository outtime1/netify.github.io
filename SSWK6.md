# Week5 Hack the Box Write Up


## What I did:
### Hack The Box
This week I focused on getting both User and root access for both Open Admin and Traverxec Hack the Box Boxes.

### Ninja night 

This week I also attended a CTF competition at the Google building in Barangaroo.

### Traverxec showcase

On Thursday we went in front of the public and showcased how we completed the box 

 
 


## Problems I Faced:
This week I struggled with the boxes that we were assigned to hack this week. I did my best in using the methods that I had previously known and also tried researching new methods 
## Reflection on last week
This week I have done my best to explain my actions as I show how I have demonstrated the subject outlines for the week. I have continued attempting to resolve the criticism of a lack of relevant artifacts by making sure that there  are plenty of relevant artifacts for the week.

## How I have achieved the Subject Outcomes

### SO1
This week I engaged with stakeholders by participating in the showcase for this week. This event allowed us to interact with people who could be interested in the field. I also engaged with stakeholders by attending the Ninjas Night CTF in which I was able to engage and interact with different experts in the Cyber security field. This included being partnered up with several associates who work at Google.
### SO2 
This week I was able to work on my design skills by considering how I would approach setting up my write up deliverables for both this week and the final submission. I used Microsoft Word again due to its ease of positioning pictures around text as well as being a simple tool. I also demonstrated design skills and system thinking when I had to prepare for the showcase on the 27th. I made a list of events that I believed demonstrated the important parts of achieving root on the Traverxec box.

### SO4 
This week I collaborated with members of team I was apart of at the Ninja Night CTF competition. Our team the Cyber Rangers included me and a few members who worked at google. Our unique differences allowed us to engage the challenge at different angles and cover more ground as a team. As such this allowed us to solve the puzzle as a team.

### SO5
TThis week saw to me reflecting on and improving upon different sections of my previous submission in my attempt to get them all to passing levels. The parts I have generally altered are the sections that relate to how I have accomplished the Subject outlines. I have sought to make these sections more lengthy so that I can more thoroughly explain why I pick certain processes and how certain elements affect what I'm doing.
