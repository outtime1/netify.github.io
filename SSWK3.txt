# Week3 Task Presentation


## What I did:
This week I was to complete a bunch of challenges on OWASP juice shop. I was able to leave  0 star review by finding a vulnerability where I removed an element before it got removed. I was able to reset Bjorn's password by doxxing his account and finding a video where he created his account. I was able to access the administrator page by finding reference to it in a java script. From there I was able to delete all 5 stars reviews using the GUI that I have. I reset Jim's Password by looking him up and finding his brothers middle name. Somehow I cracked veiwing another users basket.

## Problems I Faced:
This week I faced problems regarding communication amongst teammates, though we were able to make a group presentation together our work efforts being uncoordinated lead us to creating overlapping parts and taking over the designated time we were given to present. I plan on remedying this in the future with better group organization as well as setting out more time to focus on the timing of our presentation. We also failed to introduce our group before our presentation which can be remedied by remembering to do so before our next presentation.

Due to the criticism received from last week, I have attempted to include more artifacts in my portfolio.

## Reflection on last week
I listened to the advice given to me from my tutors and remade my week 1 reflection to better reflect what I have learned in class to better reflect what had happened that week. I went and added how I addressed the Subject Outlines in the document and also made sure I was adding artifacts in in order to validate the work that I was doing.

## How I have achieved the Subject Outcomes


### SO2
This week I was able to apply my design and system thinking skills through the development and research conducted on my presentation throughout the week. By thinking about the design of the slides I was able to create a presentation design that looked sleek but was still readable to the audience. It was also in my research of the tool I was able to comprehend how the tool functioned for website reconnaissance.

| ### SO3 |
| I was able to apply technical skills this week by working on the different puzzles that were presented to me on Over the Wire and picoCTF and complete them by using the tools available to me and also developing tools such as my Caesar Cypher solver. |

| ### SO4 |
| This week I demonstrated collaboration and communication skills through the group work that we were assigned, it was through the creation of our own Microsoft Teams group and our Facebook chat that we ensured efficient communication amongst ourselves. It was through our designation of the task that we demonstrated our collaboration skills creating a system for the presentation that was fair as well as balanced amongst students. |

### SO5
This week I conducted critical review over our group and myself by adding sections to this reflection demonstrating the pitfalls and struggles we faced during this week. It is my belief that this will allow me to review my weekly actions more critically and ensure that I learn from my past mistakes. I also received criticism from tutors during our 1 on 1's allowing me to better preform for the future weeks
